# Redis Leaderboard Implementation for Games

This repository provides an implementation of a Redis leaderboard system, specifically designed for multiplayer games such as Call of Duty and Battlegrounds. Redis is utilized due to its efficiency and ease of scaling for leaderboard operations compared to traditional databases.

## Redis Overview

Redis is a single-threaded, in-memory data store that uses the Redis Serialization Protocol (RESP) over TCP, making it exceptionally fast for handling operations like leaderboard management. Scaling for leaderboards is straightforward in Redis due to its built-in support for sorted sets.

## Features

1. **Leaderboard Management**: Maintain leaderboards for games with support for player scores, rankings, and more.
2. **Game Creation**: APIs to create new game instances.
3. **Game Completion**: APIs to end games and update scores.

## Installation

To use this system, ensure you have Redis installed and running. You can install Redis from [redis.io](https://redis.io/download).
